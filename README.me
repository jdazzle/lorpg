This is my pet project to create a Local Online Role Playing Game (LORPG).  It's like a MMORPG, except only for a local group of friends hosted on a private router.  The goal is to create a simple 2D game interface that can be easily customizable, and run with minimal hardware and eventually, minimal setup.
